# Theory-of-Compututions-TOC
What is a TOC in computer? Theory of computation (TOC) is a branch of Computer Science that is concerned with how problems can be solved using algorithms and how efficiently they can be solved. Real-world computers perform computations that by nature run like mathematical models to solve problems in systematic ways.
